# Project idea:
###### The project was conceived with the idea of creating something new for someone and adding another project to my portfolio. I designed the entire site independently in Figma. Unfortunately, I didn't save the project, which was my mistake. I believe it is one of the most visually appealing projects in my portfolio.

# Technologies:
### Frontend:
- Figma
- Vue.js
- Vuex
- Vue Router
- Quasar Framework
- CSS/SCSS
### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JWT
- Postgresql 14
### DevOps
- Nginx
- My VPS for hosting -> hosting: ovh.pl
- Linux

## Conclusion
##### In retrospect, the project was very simple, but it was complete enough to allow me to create websites with a full user panel + CRUD + Photos.
